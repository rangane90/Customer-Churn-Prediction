# Customer-Churn-Prediction

## Overview
This project is focused on predicting customer churn in the telecom sector using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this analysis is the **Telecom Churn Dataset**, which contains various customer attributes, service usage data, and churn labels.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers at risk of churning. By leveraging different machine learning algorithms, we aim to provide insights that can help telecom companies implement targeted retention strategies.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle / Public dataset
- **Features:** Customer demographics, service usage, billing information, contract details, etc.
- **Target Variable:** Churn (Yes/No)

## Methodology
The project follows a structured approach:
1. **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature selection & engineering
   - Encoding categorical variables
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution analysis
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Feature importance
3. **Model Selection & Training**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.)
4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - ROC Curve & AUC
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Grid Search & Randomized Search
6. **Deployment (Optional)**
   - Saving the model
   - API integration

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Tools:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow/Keras (if deep learning is applied)
- **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook

## Results & Findings
- Identified key factors contributing to churn
- Achieved high prediction accuracy using optimized models
- Provided business insights for reducing churn rates

## How to Use
